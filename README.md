*DOMish* is a simplified pure JavaScript implementation of the DOM
intended to be used in server-side JavaScript environments without a DOM
implementation.

*DOMish* has plenty of limitations, and is really designed to meet the
very minimum requirements for managing a virtual DOM, so it doesn't
support features like selectors, or events, for instance.
